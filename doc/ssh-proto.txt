the ssh wire protocol.

this is actually what the http wire protocol seems to be based
around, and seems more generally useful:  any file descriptor that
talks this protocol can be used for push/pull.  perhaps the hgfs
wire file should be taught to talk it.

the command are described in http-proto.txt.  they do the same,
just their request/response format has to be specified.
the format of a request is:

	<command>\n<args>

note: no newline after args!  args are the arguments for the command.
all those defined for a command must be present (unlike in the http
variant!).  "args" is the concatenation of each "arg".
an "arg" is:

	<name> <length>\n<length bytes for value>

note that there is no newline after the value, between the name and
length of the value is a space.

as with http, some responses have newlines in them, some do not.

ssh does not have a capababilities command.  instead, it has a
"hello" command.  it returns a line (with newline!) starting with
"capababilities: " and followed by what seems to be a normal
"capabilities" response, but with a newline appened.
