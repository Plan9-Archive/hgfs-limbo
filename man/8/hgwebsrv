.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Websrv
serves the mercurial pull protocol over http.  This protocol helps
pull updates from a remote mercurial repository quickly and in a
bandwidth-efficient manner.
The mercurial repository in the working directory is served.  This
behaviour can be changed with the options.
.PP
Options:
.TP
.BI -a " repodir"
Treat
.I repodir
as a directory that contains repositories and use the last path
element from the environment's variable
.I PATH_INFO
as the repository directory.  This makes it easy to serve many
mercurial repositories.
.TP
.BI -h " path"
Use
.I path
as the repository.
.TP
.B -d
Print debugging information.
.PP
Note that
.B -a
and
.B -h
are conflicting options.
.SH EXAMPLES
Start a httpd to serve the repository in the current directory:

.EX
	httpd -c / {hg/websrv -d} GET .
.EE
