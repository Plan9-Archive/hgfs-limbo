# status

hg/fs can be used (reads repositories).  the other tools, that write
to the repository, are not yet safe to use.


# intro

hgfs serves the contents of a mercurial repository over styx.  see the
manual page hgfs(4) for more details.  the code for parsing the mercurial
repositories is in a separate library (though undocumented), and there
are a few more small programs that read various information from the
repositories (also undocumented).


# install

first, make sure you have "util", "http", "filtertool" installed.

change mkconfig if you do not have $ROOT set.  create the directory
$ROOT/dis/hg.  now "mk install" to compile and install the files.

if you want to install hg/websrv, the http pull protocol server,
you'll need need "web":

	http://www.ueber.net/code/r/web

and a separate "mk install" in appl/cmd/cgi/.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.

# todo

- make lib out of code for commit,clone,pull
- read up on all the formats.  dirstate, undo.dirstate undo.branch
  (for rollback), journal.dirstate, journal.branch, wlock;  lock,
  journal, fncache, etc.;  http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/FileFormats
- hg/commit: split into .d files at 128k size of .i
- hg/add, hg/remove, hg/commit: make sure dirstate is complete before using it
- hg/clone: write dirstate?  write other states.
- hg/identify:  print + for local changes, multiple parents
- library: when finding tags, look at the .hgtags for each head, on conflict make the most recent head win.

- cgi/websrv: test with various client versions

- hg/fs: "default" in the listings is ugly.  it would make sense
  to name "default-tip" just "tip", but that's confusing with standard
  mercurial practice.  better solution?

- library: make proper binary diffs.  helps cgi/websrv.

more cpu & memory efficient:

- binary search on Manifest
- currently a big repository uses too much memory and is slow.  e.g.
  the inferno-os hg tree.  the manifest uses lots of memory.  perhaps
  hg/fs shouldn't create a Revtree in memory, but fulfil readdirs/walks
  from the manifest file on the fly.  i think the paths in the
  manifest are sorted.  so we can do a binary search for the current
  path.  then it's a matter of returning a proper qid.  with current
  gens (increase with each path), we would need to do some trick
  (some offsets with known gens) to start counting from.
- for cpu usage, perhaps we need a binary tree lookup of nodeid -> rev?
- prevent string formatting for debug messages in often-run code.
- perhaps we should cache Group's for revlog's?  seems more useful
  than storing raw delta's.  does require one base in memory...
- findgen in hg/fs currently uses lots of cpu.  make more efficient.
- see how memory usage of list of int vs array of int compare.
  might be part of the high mem usage for hgfs File's.
- do we keep Manifest & Manifestfile in memory?  perhaps we can do
  without and save memory.
- should not have fixed number of rev's cached data, but one
  base+delta's?  or perhaps not the base as it's pretty big (half
  the size of the delta's i think) and can be read quickly?
- in hgwire, when making changegroup with changes with big manifests, it will
  help to only look at manifest changes.  now we process all path+nodeid's
  in the whole manifest.  all unchanged path+nodeid's don't even need
  looking at.  if we can make sequential manifest fetching faster
  that would help as well.

- use more from nsz's excellent docs in his hgc, at https://sharesource.org/hg/hgc/
- think about other tools such as pull & clone.

## future

- real fncache support.  have to figure out why the fncache file exists (not sure why repo files are listed, they can be derived and you normally don't need this).  windows special files may be more useful to escape.
- local tags?
- ignore files?
