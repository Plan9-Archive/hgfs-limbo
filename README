# intro

hgfs serves the contents of a mercurial repository over styx.  see the
manual page hgfs(4) for more details.  the code for parsing the mercurial
repositories is in a separate library (though undocumented), and there
are a few more small programs that read various information from the
repositories (also undocumented).


# install

first, ensure a "mkconfig" file is present.  a bind/symlink to the
mkconfig of your inferno install should do.  create the directory
$ROOT/dis/hg.  now "mk install" to compile and install the files.


# latest version

the latest version can be found at:

# licence & author

all files are in the public domain.  this code has been written by
mechiel lukkien, reachable at mechiel@ueber.net or mechiel@xs4all.nl.


# todo

- hg/fs: improve bookkeeping for revtree:  don't store full path, and
  keep track of gen of higher directory, for quick walk to ..
- hg/fs: add another tree that lists .i(/.d) files.  reading them gives
  back revision numbers
- hg/fs: add directories in .tgz's?  now only the files added.
- hg/fs: use Revtree etc. for creating .tgz's?
- hg/fs: show not only last revision in files/* etc, but tags&branches too?
- hg/fs: make a plan to properly show tags&branches
- hg/fs: make plan to deal with revisions-by-nodeid.  just revision
  number is not good enough.

- library: have to detect when .i-only is changed into using .d;  have
  to invalidate/fix cache
- library: understand more revlog revision & flags in .i?
- library: merge patches from different revisions before applying.
- library: apply patches more efficiently.

- use more from nsz's excellent docs in his hgc, at https://sharesource.org/hg/hgc/
- think about implementing the low-latency update protocol, server side.
- think about other tools such as pull & clone.
- could implement a httpfs that serves a http url with plain http.
  since readdirs & stats cannot be done, it has to be special.  walks
  would always succeed.  all opens/reads are assumed to be on plain
  files.  this could then be used to serve static-http repo's.  but
  it sounds ugly/fiddly.
